# Capstone_sentiment_analysis

This projectâ€™s goal was to use a machine learning algorithm to extract the sentiment contained into a review
and try to predict the outcome of such review, as Good or Bad, using only the text that was written,
regardless the user or product. This work is a requirement to achieve a passing grade in the Data Science
Professional Certificate Program, provided by Harvard University through edX.
